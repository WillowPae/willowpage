          <td> My mom came to the U.S. from South Korea when she was 5 years old. She lived in the suburbs of Chicago and went to school at the University of Illinois where she studied accounting. After she married my dad, she decided to become a stay at home mom. She loves working with charities and volunteering at our church, and of course being a mother to my sisters and me. </td>
          <td> My dad came to the U.S. from South Korea when he was 16 years old. He lived in Salt Lake City, Utah and later went to Rush Medical School in Chicago. He is an OBGYN doctor, so he is surrounded by women all day (even my dog is a girl). On his spare time, he loves learning about stocks and playing racquetball with his coworkers. </td>
          <td> My eldest sister, Alexis, went to Phillips Exeter (boo) and then later went to University of Wisconsin in Madison. She is now working at Goldman in New York City. Ever since we were younger, Alexis would always be occupied doing something, whether it was dance, origami, or reading she would always be busy. </td>
          <td> My middle sister, Esther, stayed at home for high school but is now a senior at Texas Christian University where she is majoring in business. She also keeps herself busy on campus by dancing on TCU's dance team where she cheers at football games, basketball games, and even baseball games and participating in her sorority. </td>
          <td> Addie is a 7-year-old Bichon Frise Shih Tzu mix. She is a 10-pound ball of fluff with white fur with tan ears. She, oddly, hates men, beeping noises, and baths! </td>
